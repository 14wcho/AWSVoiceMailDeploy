# Voicemail for Amazon Connect
This solutions deploys the resources necessary to configure a voicemail system to use with Amazon Connect. See [Solution Architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/voicemail-for-amazon-connect/).

## Development Branch
We have added a new branch to this solution: the "development" branch. The "development" branch contains the same solution, but has a simplified build system that removes complexities introduced by the AWS Solution. If you would like to pull down this code to modify it for your own testing, you should use the "development" branch. The "development" branch is where we will accept PRs and continue to build out the Voicemail solution with more functionality based on feedback from users. We will update the "master" branch with changes from the "development" branch twice a year.

## Running unit tests for customization
* Clone the repository, then make the desired code changes
* Next, run unit tests to make sure added customization passes the tests
```
cd ./source/aws-connect-vm-serverless
npm run test
```

## Building distributable for customization
* Configure the bucket name of your target Amazon S3 distribution bucket
```
export DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=my-bucket-name # bucket where customized code will reside
export SOLUTION_NAME=my-solution-name
export VERSION=my-version # version number for the customized code
```
_Note:_ You would have to create an S3 bucket with the prefix 'my-bucket-name-<aws_region>'; aws_region is where you are testing the customized solution. Also, the assets in bucket should be publicly accessible.

* Now build the distributable:
```
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh \n
./build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $VERSION \n
```

* Deploy the distributable to an Amazon S3 bucket in your account. _Note:_ you must have the AWS Command Line Interface installed.
```
aws s3 cp ./dist/ s3://my-bucket-name-<aws_region>/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control --profile aws-cred-profile-name \n
```

* Get the link of the solution template uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket.
* Deploy the solution to your account by launching a new AWS CloudFormation stack using the link of the solution template in Amazon S3.

## File Structure

```
|-deployment/
  |-build-s3-dist.sh             [ shell script for packaging distribution assets ]
  |-run-unit-tests.sh            [ shell script for executing unit tests ]
  |-solution.yaml                [ solution CloudFormation deployment template ]
|-source/
  |-example-function-js          [ Example microservice function in javascript ]
    |- lib/                      [ Example function libraries ]
  |-example-function-py          [ Example microservice function in python ]

```

Each microservice follows the structure of:

```
|-service-name/
  |-lib/
    |-[service module libraries and unit tests]
  |-index.js [injection point for microservice]
  |-package.json
```
